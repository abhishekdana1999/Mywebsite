Your responsibility is to discover why individuals are bouncing in such high numbers.</p><h2 id=\"optimize-your-bounce-rate\">Optimize your bounce rate</h2><p>Inspect your bounce rate from alternate points of view. For instance:</p><blockquote>The Audience Overview report gives the general skip rate to your site.</blockquote><blockquote>The Channels report gives the skip rate to each channel gathering.</blockquote><blockquote>The All Traffic report gives the skip rate to each source/medium pair.</blockquote><blockquote>The All Pages report gives the skip rate to individual pages.</blockquote><p>On the off chance that your general bounce rate is high, at that point you can burrow further to see whether it's consistently high or whether it's the aftereffect of something like a couple of channels, source/medium sets, or only a couple of pages.</p><p>For instance, if only a couple of pages are the issue, look at whether the substance relates well with the showcasing you use to drive clients to those pages and whether those pages offer clients simple ways to the following stages you need them to take.</p><p>In the event that a specific channel has a high bounce rate, investigate your promoting endeavors for that channel: for instance, if clients coming by means of presentation are bouncing, ensure your advertisements are pertinent to your site content.</p><p>On the off chance that the issue is increasing across the board, investigate your following code used to make sure all the important pages are labeled and that they're labeled effectively. Furthermore, you might need to rethink your general site structure and inspect the language, illustrations, shading, suggestions to take action, and perceivability of significant page components.</p>",

Besides, a fragmented port for Qt additionally exists.</p><h2 id=\"why-react-native\">Why React Native?</h2><p>It is unquestionably an intriguing structure that encourages web engineers to make hearty versatile applications utilizing their current Javascript libraries. The reward point over it is that: it is quicker versatile improvement, increasingly effective code sharing crosswise over cross stages like iOS, Android and the web without yielding the end client's understanding or application quality. On the off chance that your designers can deal with the vulnerability that accompanies working with another innovation, and needs to create portable applications for something beyond one stage, you ought to take a gander at React Native.</p><h3 id=\"advantages-of-react-native-\">Advantages of React Native:-</h3><p>Suitable for Developers:- While being developed cycle when making changes, for web improvement one can take off changes by invigorating the program yet in versatile advancement, you have to convey the code-cycle each to actualize the changes. It isn't important to re-arrange the whole application to be remade each time you make changes.</p><p>Cost decrease and reuse:- By utilizing React Native, you can utilize indistinguishable code for sending on iOS from well as on Android. This takes you to colossal sparing being developed time and cash. According to the counts 90% of the code can be reused among Android and iOS which is simply excessively great, sparing part of time in addition to some additional time for adjustments that is it.</p><p>Live Reloading:- Testing is done each time when some change is made in the code composed will reflect live in the portable screen. With React Native, it expels the need of recompilation of the application each time a change has been made.If you have two windows opened – one containing the code and the other demonstrating a versatile screen because of the code – you can quickly observe the impact of what you have changed in one screen, on the other screen.</p><p>Best for portable situations utilizing troubleshooting apparatuses:- React local gives you advantage of utilizing wise investigating devices which can be used of whatever content manager you lean toward for Javascript altering. Respond local does not drive you to work Xcode to create for iOS or Android. Respond local is superfast and is very much tuned to cell phones.</p><h2 id=\"let-s-see-how-we-can-integrate-firebase-to-our-app\">Let's see how we can integrate firebase to our app</h2><p>Step 1 ) Go to firebase console and create a project from <a href=\"http://console.firebase.google.com\">here</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.smartcodehub.com/content/images/2019/08/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.smartcodehub.com/content/images/2019/08/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.smartcodehub.com/content/images/2019/08/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.smartcodehub.com/content/images/2019/08/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Step 2 ) Add the web app to firebase.By clicking on the button in white square.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.smartcodehub.com/content/images/2019/08/image-6.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.smartcodehub.com/content/images/2019/08/image-7.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>After clicking on the register button you will get the firebase config key.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>var firebaseConfig ={    \napiKey:\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",    \nauthDomain:\"xxxxxx.firebaseapp.com\",    databaseURL:\"https://xxxxx.firebaseio.com\",    \nprojectId:\"xxxxx\",    \nstorageBucket:\"\",    \nmessagingSenderId:\"xxxxxxxxxxx\",    \nappId:\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"  \n};  // Initialize Firebase  \n\nfirebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>Now save it somewhere because we need it in our app and click on continue to console button.</p><p>Step 3 ) Let make the react App.</p><p>First install the expo cli globally.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>npm i -g expo-cli</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>Now make an expo app by using the above command.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>expo init ReactApp\n?
